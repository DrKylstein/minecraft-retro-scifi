ยง3My friends, you've all seen this incident, based on sworn testimony. Can you prove that it didn't happen? 
ยง3Perhaps on your way home, someone will pass you in the dark, and you will never know it, for they will be from outer space! 
ยง3Many scientist believe that another world is watching us at this moment! We once laughed at the horseless carriage, the aeroplane, the telephone, the electric light, the vitamins, radio, and even television. Now some of us laugh at outer space. 
ยง3God help us, in the future.
